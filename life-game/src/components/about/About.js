      <h2>What is "Conway's Game of Life"?</h2>
      <h3 className='polyas-heading'>Understanding the Problem</h3>
      <p className='polyas-content'>
        A mathematician named John Conway created this zero-player game in 1970
        to create a model that enabled him to study "cellular automata" (the
        plural form of "cellular automaton"). A cellular automaton is a
        collection of cells on a grid that evolve over "generations" (a unit of
        time measurement in the game) according to rules based on the "states"
        ("alive" or "dead") neighboring cells.
